# Temperature-Converter
Convert between Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit and Rankine!

## Project
This project was created with [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang) and, above all, with ❤️.

## How to use
You cand find the executable `.exe`  in `target\debug\deps`. However, you can run the program in the console with the command `cargo run`. If you want to build the application in release then run at the console `cargo build --release` and then you will find the `.exe` in `target\release`.

This assumes you have `rustup` installed on your OS, which has `cargo` installed as well.
